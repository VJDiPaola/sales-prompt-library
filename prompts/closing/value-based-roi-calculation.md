# Value-Based Selling: ROI Calculation

**Use Case:** To create a simple, compelling ROI calculation that justifies the purchase of your solution, focusing on the value it delivers rather than just the cost.
**Input Required:** [customer cost of inaction], [our solution cost], [key value metric our solution improves]

## Prompt

I need to build a simple ROI calculation for a prospect based on the principles of Value-Based Selling.

Here is the data:
- The prospect's estimated annual cost of their current problem (cost of inaction) is [customer cost of inaction].
- The annual cost of our solution is [our solution cost].
- The key value metric we improve is [key value metric our solution improves].

Generate a 3-step calculation that I can include in a proposal or email, showing:
1.  The total net savings/gain.
2.  The Return on Investment (ROI) percentage.
3.  A simple sentence that frames the investment in terms of the value delivered.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Customer Cost of Inaction: $250,000 per year in wasted engineering time.
-   Our Solution Cost: $50,000 per year.
-   Key Value Metric: Developer Productivity

**Output:**

Here is a simple ROI calculation based on the value you'd receive:

1.  **Estimated Annual Savings:**
    -   Cost of Current Problem: $250,000
    -   Cost of Our Solution: -$50,000
    -   **Net Annual Savings: $200,000**

2.  **Return on Investment (ROI):**
    -   (Net Savings / Cost of Solution) * 100
    -   ($200,000 / $50,000) * 100 = **400% ROI**

3.  **Value-Based Summary:**
    -   "Based on these numbers, for every $1 you invest in improving developer productivity with our solution, you can expect to get $4 back in reclaimed engineering time within the first year."

## Tips
- Use the prospect's own numbers whenever possible to build credibility.
- Keep the calculation simple and easy to understand. Avoid complex spreadsheets in the initial proposal.
- The summary sentence is often the most powerful part of this prompt. Make sure it's clear and compelling.
