# Executive Summary for Proposals

**Use Case:** Turn your detailed proposal into a 1-page summary for the CEO/CFO
**Input Required:** [full proposal] or [key points: problem, solution, price, ROI]

## Prompt

Convert this proposal into a 250-word executive summary for [CEO/CFO name]:

[Paste your full proposal here, or key points]

Structure it like this:

1. **Problem (2 sentences):** What's broken and what it costs them in $ or hours—use THEIR numbers from discovery

2. **Solution (2 sentences):** What you're providing in plain English (no jargon). How it fixes the problem.

3. **Why Now (1 sentence):** Risk of waiting or competitive pressure

4. **Investment & ROI (3 sentences):** 
   - Total cost
   - Payback period (when they break even)
   - 3-year value

5. **Next Step (1 sentence):** The one decision they need to make and the deadline

**Tone:** Direct and confident, use their own words from earlier conversations

## Example Output

**Problem:**  
Your engineering team spends 18 hours per week on manual deployments, costing $156K annually in lost productivity. This delays feature releases by an average of 11 days, letting competitors ship faster.

**Solution:**  
Our deployment automation platform eliminates manual steps and cuts release cycles from 3 weeks to 4 days. Your team configures it once, then deploys with one click.

**Why Now:**  
Your VP mentioned the Q3 goal to launch 5 new features. Current deployment speed makes that impossible without adding headcount.

**Investment & ROI:**  
- Total: $85K first year (includes setup + annual license)  
- Payback: 6.5 months  
- 3-year value: $312K in saved labor + faster time-to-market

**Next Step:**  
Approve this proposal by [date] to start implementation before Q3 planning begins.

## Tips
- Lead with the ROI number (e.g., "3.2x return")
- Move all technical details to an appendix
