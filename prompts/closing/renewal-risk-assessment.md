_# Renewal Risk Assessment

**Use Case:** To proactively assess the health of a customer account ahead of a renewal, identifying potential risks and creating a plan to mitigate them.
**Input Required:** [customer name], [renewal date], [key success metrics from original sale], [current product usage data]

## Prompt

I need to conduct a renewal risk assessment for my customer, [customer name]. Their renewal is on [renewal date].

When they originally purchased, their key success metrics were: [key success metrics from original sale].
Their current product usage data shows: [current product usage data] (e.g., "high/low user adoption," "using key features A & B but not C," "few support tickets").

Generate a 4-part risk assessment based on this information:
1.  **Success Metrics Review:** Compare their original success metrics to their current usage. Is there a gap? Are they achieving the value they expected?
2.  **Usage Pattern Analysis:** Analyze their usage data for red flags (e.g., low adoption, decline in usage, key features being ignored).
3.  **Risk Level Assessment:** Based on the above, assign a risk level (Low, Medium, High) and provide a one-sentence justification.
4.  **Mitigation Plan:** Propose a 3-step mitigation plan to address the identified risks and get the account back on track before the renewal conversation.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Customer Name: Global Corp
-   Renewal Date: In 3 months
-   Original Success Metrics: Increase sales team productivity by 20%; improve forecast accuracy.
-   Current Usage Data: Only 30% of their sales team has logged in this month. They are using the reporting features but not the forecasting module.

**Output:**

Here is a renewal risk assessment for Global Corp:

**1. Success Metrics Review:**
-   There is a significant gap. Their goal was to increase team-wide productivity, but with only 30% adoption, they are not achieving this. They are also not using the forecasting module, so they are not improving their forecast accuracy.

**2. Usage Pattern Analysis:**
-   **Red Flag:** Low user adoption is a major red flag. It indicates the tool is not embedded in their daily workflow.
-   **Red Flag:** Ignoring the forecasting module means they are missing out on a key piece of value they paid for.

**3. Risk Level Assessment:**
-   **Risk Level: High.** The customer is not achieving their primary business goals with our solution, and low usage makes them highly vulnerable to churn.

**4. Mitigation Plan:**
1.  **Schedule a Business Review:** Immediately reach out to our champion to schedule a Quarterly Business Review. Frame it as a proactive check-in to ensure they are getting the full value of their investment.
2.  **Re-Onboard the Team:** During the QBR, propose a re-onboarding or training session for the sales team, focused specifically on the workflows that will help them be more productive.
3.  **Build a Forecasting Value Plan:** Work with the champion to understand why the forecasting module isn't being used. Create a specific, small pilot program with a few of their top reps to demonstrate its value ahead of the renewal.

## Tips
- Don't wait until the month before the renewal to do this. Proactive risk assessment should be an ongoing process.
- Be honest in your assessment. It's better to identify a high-risk account early and have a chance to save it.
- A good mitigation plan is specific, actionable, and time-bound._
