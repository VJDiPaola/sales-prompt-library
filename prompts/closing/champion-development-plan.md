_# MEDDIC Champion Development Plan

**Use Case:** To create a strategic plan to develop an internal contact into a true Champion who will advocate for your solution and help you win the deal.
**Input Required:** [champion candidate name], [their role], [their personal win from our solution], [gaps in our current knowledge of the deal]

## Prompt

I have identified a potential Champion, [champion candidate name], who is the [their role]. I believe their personal win from our solution would be [their personal win from our solution].

However, I still have the following gaps in my MEDDIC qualification: [gaps in our current knowledge of the deal] (e.g., "I don't know the final decision process," "I haven't met the Economic Buyer").

Generate a 3-step Champion Development Plan that I can execute over the next two weeks. The plan should include:
1.  **Testing the Champion:** A specific action I can ask them to take to test if they are willing and able to advocate for us.
2.  **Equipping the Champion:** A plan to provide them with the specific information or tools they need to sell effectively on my behalf internally.
3.  **Leveraging the Champion:** A strategy to use the Champion to fill the specific gaps in my MEDDIC knowledge.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Champion Candidate: David, Director of Engineering
-   Personal Win: He wants to reduce the amount of time his team spends on low-level maintenance tasks.
-   Gaps: I don't know the full decision criteria and haven't been introduced to the CTO (the likely Economic Buyer).

**Output:**

Here is a Champion Development Plan for David:

**1. Test the Champion (Week 1):**
-   **Action:** Ask him, "David, would you be willing to co-present a 15-minute summary of our findings to the other engineering leads? It would be powerful to have you share your perspective on the potential impact." His willingness to do this is a strong indicator of his commitment.

**2. Equip the Champion (Week 1):**
-   **Action:** Create a one-page summary specifically for David, tailored to an engineering audience. It should include a concise overview of the solution, a summary of the value proposition in terms of developer productivity, and a pre-built ROI calculation based on the numbers he has shared. This makes it easy for him to forward and discuss internally.

**3. Leverage the Champion (Week 2):**
-   **Action:** Once he has agreed to the internal presentation, say to him, "To make sure our conversation with the other leads is as productive as possible, it would be helpful to get your advice on the key criteria they will use to evaluate this. Also, I want to make sure we are aligned with the CTO's vision. Would you be open to making a brief introduction so I can get his perspective?"

## Tips
- A true Champion is not just a friend; they are an active advocate who works on your behalf.
- You must test your Champion. If they are not willing to take small actions for you, they are not a real Champion.
- Make it easy for your Champion to sell for you by providing them with the right tools and information._
