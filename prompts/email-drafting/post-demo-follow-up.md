# Post-Demo Follow-Up Email

**Use Case:** To send a compelling follow-up email after a product demonstration that summarizes the value, confirms next steps, and maintains momentum.
**Input Required:** [key pain points discussed], [solutions demonstrated], [agreed next steps]

## Prompt

I just finished a product demo with a prospect and need to write a follow-up email.

During the demo, we discussed:
- **Key Pain Points:** [key pain points discussed]
- **Solutions Demonstrated:** [solutions demonstrated]
- **Agreed Next Steps:** [agreed next steps]

Draft a follow-up email that follows a modern, value-focused structure:
1.  **Subject Line:** Clear and action-oriented.
2.  **Opening:** Thank them and reiterate your understanding of their primary goal.
3.  **Summary of Value:** In a bulleted list, recap the key pain points they have and connect each one to the specific solution you demonstrated.
4.  **Call to Action:** Clearly outline the agreed-upon next steps, including who is responsible for each action and the timeline.
5.  **Attachment:** Mention that you've attached a relevant case study or resource.

## Example

**Input:**
- Key Pain Points: Manual reporting is time-consuming; lack of visibility into team performance.
- Solutions Demonstrated: Automated dashboard creation; real-time performance leaderboards.
- Agreed Next Steps: I will send a proposal by EOD Friday; they will review it and schedule a call with their VP of Sales next week.

**Output:**

**Subject:** Next Steps: Improving Sales Team Visibility at [Prospect Company]

Hi [Prospect Name],

Thanks for your time today. It was great to learn more about your goal of creating a more data-driven sales culture.

To recap our conversation, here are the key challenges we discussed and how we can help:

-   **Challenge:** Your team spends 10+ hours a week on manual reporting.
    -   **Solution:** Our automated dashboards can reduce that to minutes, freeing up your team for more coaching.
-   **Challenge:** You lack real-time visibility into your team's performance.
    -   **Solution:** Our performance leaderboards provide an up-to-the-minute view, so you can see who is on track and who needs help.

As promised, I will send over a detailed proposal by the end of the day on Friday. Once you've had a chance to review it, the next step would be to schedule a brief call with your VP of Sales next week to discuss the business case.

In the meantime, I've attached a case study from a similar company that was facing the same reporting challenges. 

Best,

[Your Name]

## Tips
