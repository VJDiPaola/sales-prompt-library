# Cold Outreach Email (First Contact)

**Use Case:** Reaching out to someone who doesn't know you—no introduction
**Input Required:** [prospect name], [their company], [specific trigger event], [their likely problem]

## Prompt

Write a cold email to [prospect name], [job title] at [company name].

Use this structure:
1. **Hook (1 sentence):** Reference a specific trigger event (they just got funding, launched a product, posted a job, hit the news)
2. **Problem (1 sentence):** Connect that trigger to a common pain point for their role
3. **Proof (1 sentence):** Share one result a similar company got with our solution
4. **Ask (1 sentence):** Request a specific, short call to share one relevant insight

Rules:
- Maximum 100 words total
- No buzzwords like "synergy," "game-changer," "solutions"
- Don't mention features—focus on THEIR problem
- Subject line: [Company name] + [specific trigger], no hype words

## Example

**Input:**
- Prospect: Sarah Chen, VP Engineering at DataCorp
- Trigger: They just posted 10 engineering jobs
- Problem: Onboarding new engineers usually slows teams down

**Output:**

**Subject:** DataCorp's 10 new engineering roles

Hi Sarah,

Saw you're hiring 10 engineers—congrats on the growth. Most teams we talk to see productivity dip 30% during big hiring waves while ramping new people.

When FinTech startup [Name] doubled their eng team last year, our onboarding playbook cut ramp time from 8 weeks to 3 weeks.

Worth 15 minutes to share what worked? I have their week-by-week checklist.

[Your name]

## Tips
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm their timezone
- If no response in 4 days, try a different angle (not the same email twice)
