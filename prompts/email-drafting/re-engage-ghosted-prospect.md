# Re-Engage a Ghosted Prospect

**Use Case:** To re-engage a prospect who has gone silent after a promising initial conversation or demo, using a value-based and non-pushy approach.
**Input Required:** [prospect name], [last interaction date], [key pain point from last conversation], [new insight or value-add]

## Prompt

```text
I need to write a re-engagement email to [prospect name], who I haven't heard from since [last interaction date].

In our last conversation, their key pain point was [key pain point from last conversation]. I want to provide a new piece of value to restart the conversation.

Draft a short, 3-part email that:
1.  **References the Last Conversation:** Briefly and gently remind them of your previous discussion about their key pain point.
2.  **Provides New Value:** Share a [new insight or value-add] (e.g., a new article, a relevant case study, a short tip) that is directly related to their pain point. This is the reason for your email.
3.  **Asks a Low-Pressure Question:** End with an open-ended, low-pressure question to gauge their current interest or priorities, without directly asking for a meeting.
```

## Example

**Input:**
-   Prospect Name: Mark
-   Last Interaction: 3 weeks ago, after a demo.
-   Key Pain Point: Difficulty in forecasting sales performance accurately.
-   New Insight: A new industry report was just published on sales forecasting trends.

**Output:**

**Subject:** Thought you might find this interesting

Hi Mark,

When we last spoke a few weeks ago, we were discussing the challenges of accurately forecasting sales performance.

I saw that Gartner just released their 2025 report on sales analytics trends, and there's a section on page 8 about AI-driven forecasting that I thought you'd find valuable. It touches on some of the exact issues we discussed.

Has forecasting still been a top priority for you and the team?

Best,

[Your Name]

## Tips
- The goal is to be helpful, not to chase. Providing new value gives you a legitimate reason to be back in their inbox.
- Avoid guilt-tripping language like "just following up" or "bumping this up."
- If they still don't respond, it may be time to move on or try a different contact at the company.
