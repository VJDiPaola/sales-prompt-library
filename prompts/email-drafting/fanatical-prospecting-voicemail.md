# Fanatical Prospecting: 30-Second Voicemail

**Use Case:** To leave a concise, compelling, and professional voicemail that increases the likelihood of a callback, based on Jeb Blount's "Fanatical Prospecting" principles.
**Input Required:** [your name], [your company], [reason for calling], [specific value proposition]

## Prompt

I need to script a 30-second voicemail for a prospect, following the structure from "Fanatical Prospecting."

Here are the details:
- My Name: [your name]
- My Company: [your company]
- Reason for Calling: [reason for calling]
- Value Proposition: [specific value proposition]

Generate a voicemail script that includes:
1.  **Your Name and Company:** Stated clearly at the beginning.
2.  **The Reason for Your Call:** A brief, relevant reason for reaching out.
3.  **A Compelling Value Proposition:** A one-sentence statement about the value you can provide.
4.  **Your Contact Information:** Your name and phone number, stated clearly.
5.  **A Call to Action:** A simple request for a callback.

Rules:
- The entire voicemail should be under 30 seconds.
- The tone should be professional, confident, and enthusiastic.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Your Name: John Smith
-   Your Company: Cloud Solutions Inc.
-   Reason for Calling: I saw you are hiring for a new Head of Security.
-   Value Proposition: We help companies in the financial services industry reduce their data breach risk by 40%.

**Output:**

"Hi, this is John Smith from Cloud Solutions Inc. I'm calling because I saw you're hiring a new Head of Security, and I wanted to share how we've helped other financial services firms reduce their data breach risk by 40%.

Again, this is John Smith at 555-123-4567. I look forward to hearing from you."

## Tips
- Practice the script out loud to ensure it sounds natural and fits within the 30-second timeframe.
- Leave the voicemail at the beginning or end of the day when people are more likely to check their messages.
- Don't be discouraged if you don't get a callback. Voicemails are part of a larger prospecting strategy.
