# Follow-Up Sequence (When Prospect Goes Silent)

**Use Case:** They saw your demo/proposal but stopped responding
**Input Required:** [what happened in last interaction], [days since last contact]

## Prompt

Create a 5-email follow-up sequence for a prospect who went dark after [demo/proposal/meeting].

Last contact was [X days] ago. Spread these emails over 10 business days:

**Email 1 (Day 1):** Soft check-in
- Assume they're busy (not ignoring you)
- Offer specific help related to what you discussed
- No pressure

**Email 2 (Day 3):** Give value with no ask
- Share a relevant article, case study, or insight
- Reference something from your last conversation
- No "just checking in" language

**Email 3 (Day 5):** Address the likely objection
- Guess what might be holding them back (budget, timing, other priorities)
- Proactively answer it
- Make it easy to say "not now" vs ghosting

**Email 4 (Day 7):** Create soft urgency
- Mention a deadline (pricing change, limited slots, busy season coming)
- Must be real—don't fake urgency

**Email 5 (Day 10):** Break-up email
- Give them permission to say no
- Offer to follow up in 3-6 months instead
- Make it feel like a graceful exit

Each email: max 75 words, helpful tone (not desperate or passive-aggressive).

## Example - Email 5 (Break-up)

**Subject:** Closing the loop?

Hi [Name],

Haven't heard back—totally understand priorities shift.

Should I assume this isn't the right time and check back in Q3? Or is there something I can clear up in a quick call this week?

Either way, no hard feelings. Just want to respect your time.

[Your name]

## Why This Works
- Email 5 often gets the most responses because it removes pressure
