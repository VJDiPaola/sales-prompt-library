# Needs Analysis Prompt

**Use Case:** First discovery call to uncover core needs
**Input Required:** [company name], [industry]

## Prompt

I'm preparing for a discovery call with [company name] in the [industry] industry.

Generate 5 open-ended questions to uncover:
- Current workflow and pain points
- Goals for the next 6-12 months
- Budget and decision-making process

Format as a conversation guide with follow-up questions.

## Example

**Input:**
- Company Name: Acme Corp
- Industry: Manufacturing

**Output:**

Here are 5 discovery questions for your call with Acme Corp:

1. "Can you walk me through your current workflow from order intake to fulfillment? Where do things slow down or break?"
   - Follow-up: "How often does that happen, and what does it cost you when it does?"

2. "What are your top priorities for the next 6-12 months?"
   - Follow-up: "What's standing in the way of hitting those goals today?"

3. "How are you currently solving this problem—internal tools, manual processes, or another vendor?"
   - Follow-up: "What do you like about that approach? What's frustrating?"

4. "When you think about budget for a solution like this, is there an approved line item or would this need new approval?"
   - Follow-up: "Who else would need to weigh in on that decision?"

5. "If you could fix one thing about your current process tomorrow, what would it be?"
   - Follow-up: "What would that improvement mean for your team's day-to-day?"

## Tips
- Ask open-ended questions—avoid anything answerable with "yes" or "no"
- Listen more than you talk; aim for a 70/30 ratio (them/you)
- Take notes on exact phrases they use—mirror their language back later
