_# Conceptual Selling: Uncovering the Concept

**Use Case:** To move beyond a product-focused discussion and understand the prospect's deeper business concept or vision that your solution can help them achieve.
**Input Required:** [prospect's stated need], [our product category]

## Prompt

I'm in a discovery call, and the prospect has stated their need as [prospect's stated need]. I want to use Conceptual Selling to understand the bigger picture.

Generate 5 questions that will help me uncover their "concept" of a solution. The questions should encourage them to describe their ideal outcome and the business value they associate with it, rather than just the features they think they need.

The questions should fall into these categories:
- **Confirmation Questions:** To clarify what I've heard.
- **New Information Questions:** To understand their vision.
- **Attitude Questions:** To learn what's important to them personally.
- **Commitment Questions:** To gauge their seriousness.
- **Basic Issue Questions:** To uncover potential roadblocks.

## Example

**Input:**
- Prospect's Stated Need: "We need a new CRM."
- Our Product Category: A CRM with heavy AI-based automation.

**Output:**

Here are 5 Conceptual Selling questions to uncover their vision:

1.  **Confirmation:** "So, just to confirm, you're looking for a new CRM to replace your current system. Is that correct?"
2.  **New Information:** "Stepping back from the features for a moment, if you had the perfect system in place a year from now, what would that have allowed your sales team to achieve? What would be different about your business?"
3.  **Attitude:** "As the leader of this team, what's the most important aspect of this project for you personally? Is it about efficiency, growth, team morale, or something else?"
4.  **Commitment:** "To achieve that vision of a more automated sales process, what level of investment—in terms of time and resources—is the organization prepared to make?"
5.  **Basic Issue:** "What do you see as the biggest potential obstacle to getting your entire team to adopt and fully utilize a new system like this?"

## Tips
- Conceptual selling elevates the conversation from a commodity to a strategic partnership.
- People buy into concepts and solutions, not just products.
- Understanding their concept allows you to tailor your entire sales process to their vision._
