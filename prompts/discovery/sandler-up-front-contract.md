# Sandler Selling: Up-Front Contract

**Use Case:** To establish a clear agenda, expectations, and potential outcomes for a meeting at the very beginning, giving the prospect a sense of control and predictability.
**Input Required:** [meeting purpose], [your desired outcome], [prospect's likely desired outcome]

## Prompt

I need to set an Up-Front Contract at the beginning of a meeting, based on the Sandler Selling System.

Here are the meeting details:
-   **Purpose:** [meeting purpose] (e.g., "a 30-minute initial discovery call")
-   **My Desired Outcome:** [your desired outcome] (e.g., "to understand your goals and see if we can help")
-   **Prospect's Likely Desired Outcome:** [prospect's likely desired outcome] (e.g., "to see if our solution is a viable option to solve their problem")

Generate a short, conversational script for me to open the meeting. The script must cover:
1.  **Time & Agenda:** Confirm the meeting length and the topics to be discussed.
2.  **Prospect's Role:** State what you hope to learn from them.
3.  **Your Role:** State what they can expect from you.
4.  **Potential Outcomes:** Clearly state the possible outcomes of the meeting, including the possibility that it's *not* a good fit, which gives them an easy "out."

## Example

**Input:**
-   Meeting Purpose: A 30-minute discovery call about their content marketing process.
-   My Desired Outcome: To see if our content optimization platform is a potential fit.
-   Prospect's Desired Outcome: To find a way to increase their content ROI.

**Output:**

"Thanks for taking the time today. We have about 30 minutes scheduled. My goal is to learn more about your current content marketing process and your goals for the rest of the year. I'll be happy to share a bit about how we've helped other B2B SaaS companies increase their content ROI.

At the end of our chat, we should have a clear idea of whether our platform might be a good fit for you. If it is, we can schedule a follow-up. If it's not, that's perfectly okay too, and we can part as friends. Does that sound fair?"

## Tips
-   Setting an Up-Front Contract builds trust and reduces the prospect's defensiveness.
-   Always end with a question like "Does that sound fair?" to get their buy-in.
-   This technique prevents "think it overs" by establishing clear next steps (or non-steps) from the start.
