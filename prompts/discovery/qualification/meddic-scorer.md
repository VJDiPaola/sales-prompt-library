# MEDDIC Deal Qualification

**Use Case:** After discovery call—decide if this deal is worth pursuing
**Input Required:** Your call notes or recording transcript

## Prompt

Analyze these sales call notes using MEDDIC framework:

[Paste your call notes here]

Score each category 0-10 and tell me what's missing:

1. **Metrics:** Did we quantify the problem in dollars or hours?
2. **Economic Buyer:** Do we know who signs the contract and have we talked to them?
3. **Decision Criteria:** What are they evaluating us on? (price, features, security, etc.)
4. **Decision Process:** Who needs to approve? What's the timeline?
5. **Identify Pain:** Is this a real urgent problem or just nice-to-have?
6. **Champion:** Do we have an internal ally selling for us when we're not in the room?

For each low score (below 7), tell me what question to ask in the next meeting.

## Example Output

**Metrics (4/10):** They said "takes too long" but no specific hours or cost.  
→ Next call, ask: "If we cut this down by 50%, how many hours per week does that free up? What's your team's hourly cost?"

**Economic Buyer (2/10):** Only spoke with manager. VP of Operations signs contracts over $25K.  
→ Red flag! Ask your contact: "Who needs to approve this purchase? Can you introduce me?"
