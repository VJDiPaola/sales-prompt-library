# Gap Selling: Current State vs. Future State

**Use Case:** To structure a discovery conversation around the Gap Selling methodology, focusing on the quantifiable gap between the prospect's current state and desired future state.
**Input Required:** [prospect company], [prospect industry], [known pain point], [our solution's primary outcome]

## Prompt

```text
I am preparing for a discovery call with [prospect company] in the [prospect industry]. Their likely pain point is [known pain point], and our solution delivers [our solution's primary outcome].

Generate a set of questions based on Keenan's Gap Selling methodology to uncover the following:

1.  **The Physical and Technical Current State:** Questions to understand their current process, tools, and workflows in detail.
2.  **The Problem and Its Impact:** Questions to explore the negative consequences (e.g., time wasted, revenue lost, errors) of their current state.
3.  **The Desired Future State:** Questions to help them articulate a vision for a better future and what they want to achieve.
4.  **The Gap and Its Value:** Questions that quantify the gap between their current and future state, establishing the value of making a change.
```

## Example

**Input:**
-   Prospect Company: A logistics company
-   Industry: Transportation
-   Known Pain Point: Inefficient manual routing for their delivery fleet.
-   Solution Outcome: Automated, optimized routing that saves fuel and time.

**Output:**

Here is a Gap Selling question guide:

**1. Current State:**
-   "Can you walk me through exactly how a route is planned for a driver, from the moment an order comes in to when the driver leaves the depot?"
-   "What tools or software are you currently using for this process? Is it primarily manual, using spreadsheets or maps?"
-   "How many planners and how many hours does it take to create the daily routes for your fleet of 50 vehicles?"

**2. Problem & Impact:**
-   "What happens when there's a last-minute change or a driver calls in sick? How much time does it take to re-route everything?"
-   "When you've analyzed it, what does an inefficient route typically cost you in terms of excess fuel or driver overtime?"
-   "Have you ever lost a customer or received complaints due to late deliveries caused by routing issues?"

**3. Future State:**
-   "In a perfect world, how long would you want your route planning process to take each morning?"
-   "If routing was completely automated and optimized, what would your team be able to focus on instead?"
-   "What would achieving a 99.5% on-time delivery rate mean for your business and your customer relationships?"

**4. The Gap & Its Value:**
-   "So, it sounds like you're currently spending about 20 planner-hours per week on routing. If you could get that down to 2 hours, that's 18 hours you could re-invest in other high-value activities. Is that right?"
-   "You mentioned a single inefficient route could cost $150 in overtime. If that happens even 10 times a week, that's $1,500 a week, or $78,000 a year. Does that sound correct?"

## Tips
- The key is to get the prospect to quantify their own pain and the value of the solution.
- The salesperson's role is to guide the conversation, not to provide the numbers themselves.
- A well-defined gap creates a powerful and urgent reason for the prospect to change.
