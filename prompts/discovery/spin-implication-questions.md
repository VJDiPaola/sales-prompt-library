# SPIN Selling: Implication Questions

**Use Case:** To help a prospect understand the full consequences and downstream effects of a problem they've acknowledged, creating a sense of urgency.
**Input Required:** [prospect's acknowledged problem]

## Prompt

I am in a discovery call, and my prospect has acknowledged they are struggling with [prospect's acknowledged problem].

Based on the SPIN Selling methodology, generate 5 "Implication" questions I can ask to explore the broader business consequences of this problem. The questions should make the prospect think about the ripple effects of the issue on their team, their budget, their customers, and their strategic goals.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Prospect's Acknowledged Problem: "Our customer support team has a high agent turnover rate."

**Output:**

Here are 5 Implication questions to explore the impact of high agent turnover:

1.  "What is the effect of this high turnover on the morale and workload of your remaining senior agents?"
2.  "How much time and budget is your team investing each quarter in recruiting, hiring, and training new agents, only to have them leave?"
3.  "How might the inconsistency in service, with so many new agents on the floor, be impacting your customer satisfaction and retention rates?"
4.  "When you have to focus so much on backfilling roles, how does that affect your ability to launch new strategic initiatives or proactive support programs?"
5.  "What is the risk to the business if a key customer has a bad experience with an untrained agent during a critical moment?"

## Tips
- Implication questions are the heart of a great discovery call. They connect a seemingly small problem to significant business pain.
- Let the prospect talk. The goal is for *them* to state the implications. Your questions are just the guide.
- Follow up a good implication question with silence. Let the weight of the problem sink in.
