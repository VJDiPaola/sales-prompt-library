_# Challenger Sale "Teach" Moment

**Use Case:** To prepare a "Challenger Sale" teaching moment that reframes a prospect's understanding of their problem and introduces a new, unconsidered need.
**Input Required:** [prospect company], [prospect industry], [known prospect problem], [our unique solution's key differentiator]

## Prompt

I need to prepare a Challenger Sale teaching point for a conversation with [prospect company], which is in the [prospect industry].

Their known problem is [known prospect problem]. Our solution's key differentiator is [our unique solution's key differentiator].

Generate a concise, 3-part narrative I can use to "teach" them something new about their business:
1.  **The Reframe:** Start by acknowledging their known problem, but then reframe it in a more insightful or challenging way. Introduce a different, more significant problem they may not be considering.
2.  **Rational Drowning:** Provide a surprising statistic or a short, compelling business case that illustrates the negative impact of this new, unconsidered problem. Make the pain of the status quo clear.
3.  **A New Way:** Hint at a new approach or capability that solves this newly reframed problem, leading naturally to our solution's unique differentiator without explicitly pitching the product.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Prospect Company: A mid-sized e-commerce company
-   Prospect Industry: Online Retail
-   Known Prospect Problem: High shopping cart abandonment rates.
-   Our Differentiator: We can predict user intent to abandon *before* they leave the page using mouse movement analysis.

**Output:**

Here is a Challenger Sale teaching narrative:

1.  **The Reframe:** "Many e-commerce leaders are focused on recovering abandoned carts after a user has already left the site. But what if the real problem isn't recovery, but the failure to intervene in the critical 5-10 seconds *before* they decide to leave? The battle is being lost before the cart is even abandoned."

2.  **Rational Drowning:** "Industry data shows that 97% of users who show high 'exit intent' signals never return to complete their purchase, even with follow-up emails. That means for every 100 users you try to win back with an email, you've already permanently lost 97 of them."

3.  **A New Way:** "So, the most successful retailers are shifting their focus from 'cart recovery' to 'intent intervention.' They are finding ways to identify and engage a user who is *about* to abandon, turning a potential loss into a saved sale in real-time. This requires a new capability to understand digital body language..."

## Tips
- The goal is to create a "wow" moment where the prospect thinks, "I never thought about it that way before."
- The reframe should be insightful and backed by data or credible logic.
- This technique positions you as a thought leader, not just a vendor._
