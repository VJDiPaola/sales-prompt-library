# Competitive Battle Card

**Use Case:** Prospect says "we're also looking at [Competitor]" or "why not [Competitor]?"
**Input Required:** [competitor name], [what they're known for]

## Prompt

Create a battle card for selling against [Competitor Name].

Include these sections:

1. **When they come up:** What stage of the deal and why (e.g., they're cheaper, they're the incumbent, they have Feature X)

2. **Our advantages (3 things):**
   - What we do better
   - Proof point for each (customer story, metric, or demo)

3. **Their advantages (1 thing - be honest):**
   - Where they actually win
   - How to minimize it (e.g., "Yes, they're cheaper upfront, but here's the total cost over 3 years...")

4. **Trap questions to ask the prospect:**
   - Questions that expose the competitor's weakness without bad-mouthing them
   - Example: "Have you asked [Competitor] how long their implementation takes? Our customers switched because theirs took 6+ months."

5. **What NOT to say:**
   - Landmines to avoid (e.g., don't claim we have Feature Y if we don't, don't trash-talk)

6. **One-sentence positioning:**
   - Why customers choose us over them

Keep it one page, bullets only (scannable in 60 seconds).

## Example

**For Competitor X (known for being cheap but slow to implement):**

✅ "Have you built out a project timeline with them? Our customers tell us their 9-month implementations were a surprise."

✅ "What's included in their price vs. ours? We've seen their 'extras' add 40% to the initial quote."

❌ DON'T SAY: "They're a terrible company" (unprofessional, makes you look desperate)

## Tips
- Quarterly: Check if competitor changed pricing, added features, or lost/won major deals
- After you lose to them: Interview the prospect to learn why
