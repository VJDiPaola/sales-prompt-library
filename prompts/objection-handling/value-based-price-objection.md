# Value-Based Price Objection Handling

**Use Case:** To respond to a price objection ("it's too expensive") by reframing the conversation around value and the cost of inaction, rather than defending the price.
**Input Required:** [prospect's stated pain point], [quantified value of solving the pain point], [our solution cost]

## Prompt

I'm facing a price objection from a prospect. They've said our solution is "too expensive."

Here's the context:
-   **Prospect's Pain Point:** [prospect's stated pain point]
-   **Quantified Value:** We've already established that this pain point is costing them approximately [quantified value of solving the pain point] per year.
-   **Our Solution Cost:** [our solution cost]

Generate a conversational response that I can use in an email or on a call. The response should:
1.  Acknowledge and validate their concern about the price (the "feel, felt, found" technique).
2.  Pivot the conversation away from cost and back to the value and the pain.
3.  Use the quantified value to reframe the price as an investment with a clear return.
4.  End with an open-ended question that focuses on the problem, not the price.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Prospect's Pain Point: Losing skilled engineers due to burnout from excessive on-call alerts.
-   Quantified Value: $500,000 per year in recruiting and lost productivity costs.
-   Our Solution Cost: $100,000 per year.

**Output:**

"I understand why you'd say that, and $100,000 is certainly a significant investment. Many of our current customers felt the same way when they first saw the price.

What they found, however, was that the real cost was the $500,000 they were losing each year to engineer turnover. When they looked at it from that perspective, the investment to solve that problem became a much easier decision.

Putting the price aside for a moment, do you believe that solving this burnout issue is one of your top priorities for the year?"

## Tips
- This technique shifts the comparison from "your price vs. competitor's price" to "your price vs. the cost of their problem."
- The goal is not to "win" the price argument, but to make the price irrelevant in the face of the value.
- If you haven't yet quantified the pain, you must do that before you can effectively handle a price objection.
