# Price Objection Response Generator

**Use Case:** Prospect says "too expensive," "we don't have budget," or "competitor is cheaper"
**Input Required:** [your price], [their objection quote], [value you proved in discovery]

## Prompt

```text
The prospect said: "[paste their exact objection]"

Context:
- Our price: $[amount]
- Competitor price (if they mentioned): $[amount]
- Value we calculated in discovery: [e.g., "saves 20 hours/week, worth $65K per year"]

Create 3 different responses I can use:

1. **Reframe on ROI:** Show how the price pays for itself using THEIR numbers
2. **Cost of doing nothing:** What happens if they don't fix this problem?
3. **Compare apples to apples:** If they mentioned a competitor, what are they missing in the cheaper option?

Each response should:
- Start by acknowledging their concern (don't argue)
- Use the metrics from our discovery call
- End with a question that moves the conversation forward
```

## Example

**Prospect said:** "Your competitor is $10K cheaper."

**Response #1 (ROI Reframe):**  
"I hear you—$10K is real money. Let me double-check my math from our last call: you said this problem wastes 15 hours per week, which at your team's cost is about $45K per year. Our solution saves that starting month 2. The competitor's tool takes 6 months to show results based on [Customer X's] experience. So you'd save an extra $22K in year one with us, even at the higher price. Does that 4-month head start matter for your Q3 goals?"

## Tips
- Never bad-mouth the competitor directly
- If they won't share competitor pricing, focus on YOUR value only
