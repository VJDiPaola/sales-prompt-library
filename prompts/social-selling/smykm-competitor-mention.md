# SMYKM Competitor Mention

**Use Case:** To craft a non-defensive, value-driven response when a prospect mentions or praises a competitor on a public platform like LinkedIn.
**Input Required:** [prospect name], [competitor name], [link to prospect's post/comment]

## Prompt

My prospect, [prospect name], just mentioned our competitor, [competitor name], in a LinkedIn post here: [link to prospect's post/comment].

Draft a public comment I can leave on the post that follows the "Show Me You Know Me" and Challenger Sale principles. The comment must:
1.  Acknowledge and validate their point about the competitor in a positive way (never criticize the competitor).
2.  Introduce a "teaching" point or a reframe that gently challenges the status quo or introduces a new, related idea they may not have considered.
3.  End with an open-ended question to spark a conversation, not to pitch.

Rules:
- The tone must be respectful, curious, and helpful.
- Do not mention my company or product directly.
- The goal is to start a conversation and position myself as a thoughtful expert.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Prospect Name: Sarah Jones
-   Competitor Name: CompetitorX
-   Link: [Hypothetical LinkedIn post where Sarah praises CompetitorX for their reporting features]

**Output:**

"Great point, Sarah. CompetitorX has definitely raised the bar on reporting dashboards. It's interesting how the conversation is shifting from just *what* to report on, to *how* to make those reports actionable for the front-line team in real-time. How are you seeing your team bridge the gap between the data and daily decisions?"

## Tips
- This approach turns a potential threat into an opportunity to engage and demonstrate expertise.
- By asking a thoughtful question, you invite a DM or a follow-up conversation.
- The goal is to be seen as part of the conversation, not as a salesperson trying to hijack it.
