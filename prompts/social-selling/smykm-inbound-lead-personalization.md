_# SMYKM Inbound Lead Personalization

**Use Case:** To apply the "Show Me You Know Me" (SMYKM) principle to an inbound lead who has downloaded content or requested a demo, ensuring the first touch is still highly personalized.
**Input Required:** [prospect name], [prospect company], [inbound action they took], [prospect's LinkedIn profile URL]

## Prompt

I have an inbound lead, [prospect name] from [prospect company], who just [inbound action they took].

Before I respond, analyze their LinkedIn profile at [prospect's LinkedIn profile URL] and generate a 2-sentence opening for my email that combines acknowledging their inbound action with a specific, personalized insight based on the SMYKM methodology.

The first sentence should acknowledge their action. The second sentence must be a personalized observation or question based on their profile that shows I've done my homework.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Prospect Name: Jane Doe
-   Prospect Company: Acme Corp
-   Inbound Action: Downloaded our "State of AI in Manufacturing" report
-   LinkedIn URL: [Hypothetical URL for Jane Doe]

**Output:**

Hi Jane,

Thanks for downloading our "State of AI in Manufacturing" report. I noticed on your profile that you recently transitioned from a hands-on engineering role to a strategic leadership position at Acme Corp; I imagine that gives you a unique perspective on how these AI trends will impact the factory floor.

## Tips
- This approach immediately elevates you from a generic "thanks for downloading" follow-up.
- The personalized insight should be a question or an observation that invites a response.
- Keep it concise. The goal is to show you know them, not to write a biography._
