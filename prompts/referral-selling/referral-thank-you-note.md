# Referral Selling: "Thank You & Keep Me Updated" Note

**Use Case:** To thank a customer for making a referral and to keep them informed on the progress, reinforcing their good decision and encouraging future referrals.
**Input Required:** [referrer name], [prospect name], [status of the referral]

## Prompt

I need to write a brief update email to [referrer name], who recently introduced me to [prospect name].

The current status of the referral is: [status of the referral] (e.g., "We had a great first call," "We have a demo scheduled for next week," "It wasn't a good fit at this time").

Draft a short, appreciative email that:
1.  Thanks them again for the introduction.
2.  Provides a concise update on the status.
3.  Reinforces that you value their trust and judgment.
4.  Closes by letting them know you'll keep them posted on any major developments.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Referrer Name: Sarah
-   Prospect Name: Tom
-   Status: We had a great first call and a demo is scheduled for next week.

**Output:**

**Subject:** Quick update on Tom

Hi Sarah,

Just wanted to say thank you again for introducing me to Tom at Acme Corp. We had a fantastic first conversation, and I'm really impressed with his team's vision. We have a demo scheduled for next week to explore things further.

I really appreciate you making the connection. I'll let you know how it progresses!

Best,

[Your Name]

## Tips
- This small gesture goes a long way in showing you are a professional who is worthy of future referrals.
- Be respectful of the prospect's confidentiality. Only share high-level, non-sensitive updates.
- If the deal closes, be sure to send a final thank you, potentially with a handwritten note or a small gift, as suggested by Sam McKenna.
