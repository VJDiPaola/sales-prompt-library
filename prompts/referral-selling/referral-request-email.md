# Referral Request Email

**Use Case:** To proactively ask a satisfied current customer for a referral to a new prospect in their network.
**Input Required:** [customer name], [customer company], [specific positive outcome they achieved], [target prospect profile/company]

## Prompt

```text
Draft an email to my current customer, [customer name] at [customer company], asking for a referral.

Follow this structure, based on Sam McKenna's methodology:
1.  **Gratitude & Value Reinforcement (2 sentences):** Start by thanking them and reminding them of the specific, positive outcome they achieved with our solution (e.g., "increased lead conversion by 22%").
2.  **The Proactive Ask (2 sentences):** State that you are looking to help other companies in a similar way and ask if they know anyone who might benefit, specifically mentioning you're looking for contacts in [target prospect profile/company].
3.  **Make it Easy (1 sentence):** Offer to provide a pre-written, forwardable email snippet to make the introduction as easy as possible for them.
4.  **No Pressure Close (1 sentence):** End with a low-pressure closing, emphasizing that you only want them to refer if they are genuinely comfortable doing so.

Rules:
- Keep the tone appreciative and respectful, not demanding.
- Focus on the value they received and how that could benefit others.
- Make the process frictionless for the referrer.
```

## Example

**Input:**
-   Customer Name: Mark Johnson
-   Customer Company: Innovate Inc.
-   Positive Outcome: They reduced their average onboarding time from 10 days to 4 days in Q3.
-   Target Prospect Profile: Other VPs of Operations in the B2B SaaS space.

**Output:**

**Subject:** A quick question

Hi Mark,

I'm so glad to hear the team at Innovate Inc. has been able to cut onboarding time down to just 4 days this quarter. It's been fantastic to see that 60% reduction in action.

As we're planning for the next quarter, I'm hoping to connect with other VPs of Operations in the B2B SaaS space who might be facing similar onboarding challenges. I was wondering if anyone in your network comes to mind who could benefit from a similar result?

I can send over a quick, forwardable blurb to make an introduction super easy on your end.

No pressure at all, but any connection you'd feel comfortable making would be hugely appreciated.

Best,

[Your Name]

## Tips
- Only send this after a recent positive interaction or business review.
- The more specific the positive outcome you reference, the more effective the request will be.
- Always follow through on your promise to provide the forwardable email snippet promptly.
