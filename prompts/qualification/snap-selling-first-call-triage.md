# SNAP Selling: First-Call Triage

**Use Case:** To quickly qualify or disqualify a prospect in the first 5-10 minutes of an initial call, respecting their time and focusing your energy on the right opportunities.
**Input Required:** [your core value proposition], [three key qualifying criteria]

## Prompt

```text
I need to create a script for the beginning of a discovery call based on Jill Konrath's SNAP Selling methodology, designed for busy prospects.

My core value proposition is [your core value proposition]. My three key qualifying criteria are:
1. [key qualifying criterion 1]
2. [key qualifying criterion 2]
3. [key qualifying criterion 3]

Generate a short, 3-question script that I can use to quickly triage the opportunity. The questions should be direct, respectful of the prospect's time, and framed to get a simple "yes" or "no" answer, allowing me to align with their priorities or disqualify quickly.
```

## Example

**Input:**
- Core Value Proposition: We help B2B companies double their inbound lead quality through data enrichment.
- Qualifying Criteria:
  1. They rely heavily on inbound marketing.
  2. They have a dedicated sales development team.
  3. They are struggling with low lead-to-opportunity conversion rates.

**Output:**

Here is a SNAP Selling triage script:

"Hi [Prospect Name], thanks for taking a few minutes. I know you're incredibly busy, so I want to be respectful of your time and get straight to the point.

I have three quick questions to see if it even makes sense for us to have a longer conversation:

1.  Is inbound lead generation a critical part of your growth strategy for this year?
2.  Do you have a team of SDRs or inside sales reps who are responsible for qualifying those leads?
3.  And finally, is improving your lead-to-opportunity conversion rate one of your top 3 priorities right now?

If the answer to all three is 'yes,' I think it's worth a deeper dive. If not, I don't want to waste your time."

## Tips
- This approach is counter-intuitive but highly effective. It shows confidence and respect for the prospect's time.
- Be prepared for them to say "no" to one of the questions. This is a good thing! It allows you to disqualify and move on.
- If they say "yes" to all three, you have their full attention and have earned the right to a more in-depth discovery.
