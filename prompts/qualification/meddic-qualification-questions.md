_# MEDDIC Qualification Questions

**Use Case:** To generate a set of qualification questions based on the MEDDIC framework to accurately assess the quality of an opportunity.
**Input Required:** [product/service], [target buyer persona], [key pain point our product solves]

## Prompt

I am selling [product/service] to a [target buyer persona]. The key pain point we solve is [key pain point our product solves].

Generate a list of 10-15 qualification questions based on the MEDDIC framework. Organize the questions under each of the MEDDIC categories:

-   **Metrics:** Questions to uncover the quantifiable goals and measures of success.
-   **Economic Buyer:** Questions to identify the person with the ultimate budgetary authority.
-   **Decision Criteria:** Questions to understand the technical and business criteria the prospect will use to evaluate solutions.
-   **Decision Process:** Questions to map out the timeline, steps, and people involved in the decision.
-   **Identify Pain:** Questions to dig deeper into the business consequences of the pain point.
-   **Champion:** Questions to identify and test for a champion who will advocate for our solution internally.

## Example

**Input:**
-   Product/Service: A new AI-powered code completion tool for developers.
-   Target Buyer Persona: VP of Engineering
-   Key Pain Point: Slow developer velocity and inconsistent code quality.

**Output:**

Here are MEDDIC qualification questions for your deal:

**Metrics:**
-   How are you currently measuring developer velocity or productivity?
-   What would be the business impact of a 15% increase in development speed?
-   Are there any specific KPIs around code quality or bug reduction you are responsible for?

**Economic Buyer:**
-   Who ultimately owns the budget for new development tools?
-   Besides yourself, who else would need to be involved in a purchasing decision of this size?
-   Can you walk me through how you have purchased similar tools in the past?

**Decision Criteria:**
-   What are the top 3-5 technical requirements for any new developer tool you bring in?

-   Is there a specific timeline you are working against for making a decision?

**Identify Pain:**

## Tips
- Use these questions as a guide, not a rigid script. Let the conversation flow naturally.
- The goal is to have a conversation, not an interrogation.
- A strong opportunity should have clear answers for most of these areas._
